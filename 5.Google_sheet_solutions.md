1. How many injuries were happened from 2012 to 2017?

      The formula "=SUM(F2:F109)" calculates the sum of values in cells F2 to F109, which represents the total number of injuries that happened 
      from 2012 to 2017.

      `=SUM(F2:F109)`


2. The data set talks about how many years of injuries?


      `=COUNTA(UNIQUE(B2:B109))`



   

3. How many types of injuries happened?

      `=COUNTA(UNIQUE(C2:C109))`




4. Which year has the fewest injuries?

   `=INDEX(B:B, MATCH(MIN(F:F), F:F, 0))`

   

5.How many injuries happened in the game in 2015?

  `=SUMIFS(F2:F109, B2:B109, 2015, D2:D109, "Game")`


6.How many ACL, MLC, and CONCUSSION injuries happened from 2012 to 2017?

`=COUNTIFS(B:B, ">="&2012, B:B, "<="&2017, C:C, "ACL Tear") + COUNTIFS(B:B, ">="&2012, B:B, "<="&2017, C:C, "MLC Tear") + COUNTIFS(B:B, ">="&2012, B:B, "<="&2017, C:C, "Concussion")` 


7.How many injuries happened in a full season in all years?

 `=SUMIFS(F2:F109, E2:E109, "Full Season")` 


8.What is the count of the ACL injuries in regular + postseason?
